GOOGLE COLAB PART:
The models of the Naive Bayed, the Decison tree and the MLP were all run on google colab. 
Orignially colab allows to run sectionally which helps me for big projects like this.
Just go on google colab -> open a notebook -> upload the file from this repository (.ipynb)


Python ID PART:
Now what google colab wasnt good for is running a program ovenright since it depends on wifi connections which can crash and everything else
So the VGG11 model is run locally on python, just run it on your local system as you would any other python file (.py)
